Bug,withdraw,,,V1.0,,ATM withdraws incorrect amounts different from what the user entered,"The system does not correctly process withdrawal amounts, leading to incorrect deductions from user accounts. The issue occurs across different account types and withdrawal values. Observed cases include:

* The app withdraws *$20* when the user enters *$200*
* The app withdraws *$100* when the user enters *$200*
* The app withdraws *$60* when the user enters *$100*
* The app withdraws *$60* when the user selects *$40*
* The app withdraws *$40* when the user selects *$20*

*Expected Outcome:*
The system should withdraw the exact amount specified by the user.

*Actual Outcome:*
The system withdraws a different amount than what was entered, leading to incorrect deductions.

Bug,Deposit,,,V1.1,,Deposit amount is reduced by $0.10 from the entered value.,"When a user deposits money, the system deducts *$0.10* from the entered deposit amount. For example, if a user deposits *$100*, the account balance reflects only *$99.90*, instead of the full deposited amount.

*Expected Outcome:*
The full deposit amount entered by the user should be credited to their account (e.g., depositing *$100* should increase the balance by *$100*).

*Bug Description:*
When a user enters an incorrect PIN on the first attempt and then enters a valid PIN on the second attempt, the system does not accept the correct PIN immediately. Instead, it prompts the user to enter the PIN again, causing unnecessary re-entry.
